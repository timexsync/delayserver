# Delayserver

Delayserver is a web server that listens on localhost port 8080 for incoming
connections and waits for the requested duration before responding. It's good
for simulating slow servers and delayed responses to test async

## Usage

In the delayserver folder run:

```
cargo run delayserver
```

You can alternatively install the program locally so it's always available in PATH:

```
cargo install --path .
```

Delay server works by issuing a http GET request in the format:

```
http://localhost:8080/[delay in ms]/[UrlEncoded meesage]
```

On reception, it immediately reports the following to the console:

```
{Message #} - {delay in ms}: {message}
```

The server then delays the response for the requested time and echoes the message back to the caller.

Please note that the message must be **Url** encoded (i.e. a space is encoded as `%20`).
